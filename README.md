- **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)**: A bond ETF tracking U.S. investment-grade bonds, providing stability and income.
- **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: An ETF tracking the S&P 500 Index, offering broad U.S. market exposure.

The data will be sourced from YFinance and cover the period from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2025.

### Expected Outcomes
#### Skills:
- Competence in time series forecasting methods (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM).
- Experience in handling and analyzing real-world financial data using YFinance.
- Ability to develop, evaluate, and deploy predictive models.
- Skills in portfolio optimization using forecast insights.

#### Knowledge:
- In-depth understanding of financial market trends.
- Proficiency in data-driven decision-making for portfolio management.
- Insights into risk management and return optimization strategies.

### Task 1: Preprocess and Explore the Data
#### Objectives:
The objective of this challenge is to equip trainees with the skills to preprocess financial data, develop time series forecasting models, analyze market trends, and optimize investment portfolios. Participants will gain hands-on experience in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance portfolio performance, minimize risks, and capitalize on market opportunities.

#### Instructions:
1. **Load, clean, and understand the data to prepare it for modeling.**
   - Extract historical financial data using YFinance for TSLA, BND, and SPY.
   - Check basic statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
   - Ensure all columns have appropriate data types and check for missing values.
   - Handle missing values by either filling, interpolating, or removing them.
   - Normalize or scale the data if required, especially for machine learning models.

2. **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the closing price over time to identify trends and patterns.
   - Calculate and plot the daily percentage change to observe volatility.
   - Analyze volatility by calculating rolling means and standard deviations to understand short-term trends and fluctuations.
   - Perform outlier detection to identify significant anomalies.
   - Analyze days with unusually high or low returns.

3. **Seasonality and Trends:**
   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components (e.g., using statsmodels).

4. **Analyze Volatility:**
   - Calculate rolling means and standard deviations to understand short-term trends and volatility.
   - Document key insights like the overall direction of Tesla’s stock price, fluctuations in daily returns and their impact, VaR, and Sharpe Ratio to assess potential losses and risk-adjusted returns.
