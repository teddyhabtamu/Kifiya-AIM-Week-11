GMF leverages cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights to provide clients with tailored investment strategies. By integrating advanced time series forecasting models, GMF aims to predict market trends, optimize asset allocation, and enhance portfolio performance. The company’s goal is to help clients achieve their financial objectives by minimizing risks and capitalizing on market opportunities.

### Situational Overview (Business Need)
As a Financial Analyst at GMF Investments, your objective is to apply time series forecasting to historical financial data to enhance portfolio management strategies. Your role involves analyzing data, building predictive models, and recommending portfolio adjustments based on forecasted trends.

### Data
Use historical financial data for three key assets:
- **Tesla (TSLA)**: High-growth, high-risk stock in the consumer discretionary sector (Automobile Manufacturing).
- **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)**: A bond ETF tracking U.S. investment-grade bonds, providing stability and income.
- **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: An ETF tracking the S&P 500 Index, offering broad U.S. market exposure.

The data will be sourced from YFinance and cover the period from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2025.

### Expected Outcomes
#### Skills:
- Competence in time series forecasting methods (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM).
- Experience in handling and analyzing real-world financial data using YFinance.
- Ability to develop, evaluate, and deploy predictive models.
- Skills in portfolio optimization using forecast insights.

#### Knowledge:
- In-depth understanding of financial market trends.
- Proficiency in data-driven decision-making for portfolio management.
- Insights into risk management and return optimization strategies.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Preprocess and Explore the Data
#### Objectives:
The objective of this challenge is to equip trainees with the skills to preprocess financial data, develop time series forecasting models, analyze market trends, and optimize investment portfolios. Participants will gain hands-on experience in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance portfolio performance, minimize risks, and capitalize on market opportunities.

#### Instructions:
1. **Load, clean, and understand the data to prepare it for modeling.**
   - Extract historical financial data using YFinance for TSLA, BND, and SPY.
   - Check basic statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
   - Ensure all columns have appropriate data types and check for missing values.
   - Handle missing values by either filling, interpolating, or removing them.
   - Normalize or scale the data if required, especially for machine learning models.

2. **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the closing price over time to identify trends and patterns.
   - Calculate and plot the daily percentage change to observe volatility.
   - Analyze volatility by calculating rolling means and standard deviations to understand short-term trends and fluctuations.
   - Perform outlier detection to identify significant anomalies.
   - Analyze days with unusually high or low returns.

3. **Seasonality and Trends:**
   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components (e.g., using statsmodels).

4. **Analyze Volatility:**
   - Calculate rolling means and standard deviations to understand short-term trends and volatility.
   - Document key insights like the overall direction of Tesla’s stock price, fluctuations in daily returns and their impact, VaR, and Sharpe Ratio to assess potential losses and risk-adjusted returns.

### Task 2: Develop Time Series Forecasting Models
#### Objectives:
Build a time series forecasting model to predict Tesla's future stock prices. Choose between classical statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) or deep learning models (LSTM).

#### Instructions:
1. **Divide the dataset into training and testing sets** to evaluate model performance.
2. **Train the Model**:
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
3. **Use the model to forecast future stock prices** and compare the predictions with the test set.
4. **Optimize Model Parameters**:
   - Use techniques like grid search or `auto_arima` from `pmdarima` library to find the best (p, d, q) parameters.
   - Calculate evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

### Task 3: Forecast Future Market Trends
#### Objectives:
Use the model developed in Task 2 to forecast Tesla's future stock prices. Generate future price predictions, analyze the results, and provide insights on potential trends and risks.

#### Instructions:
1. **Use the Trained Model for Forecasting**:
   - Generate forecasts for 6-12 months.
2. **Forecast Analysis**:
   - Visualize the forecast alongside historical data.
   - Include confidence intervals to show the range within which the future prices are expected to lie.
3. **Interpret the Results**:
   - Trend Analysis: Look for long-term trends, identify patterns or anomalies.
   - Volatility and Risk: Discuss the level of uncertainty captured by the confidence intervals, highlight periods of expected increased volatility.
   - Market Opportunities and Risks: Outline potential market opportunities and risks based on the forecast.

### Task 4: Optimize Portfolio Based on Forecast
#### Objectives:
Use the forecasted data from Task 3 to make informed decisions about optimizing a sample investment portfolio. Adjust the portfolio to maximize returns while minimizing risks based on the predicted market trends.

#### Instructions:
1. **Use a simple portfolio with three assets**:
   - Tesla Stock (TSLA) - A growth stock with higher risk.
   - Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) - A bond ETF for stability.
   - S&P 500 ETF (SPY) - An index fund for diversification.
2. **Forecast future prices for BND and SPY**.
3. **Combine the data into one DataFrame** with columns TSLA, BND, and SPY, which contain daily closing prices for each asset.
4. **Compute the annual return** by compounding the average daily returns for each asset.
5. **Use the covariance matrix** to understand how asset returns move together.
6. **Define the portfolio weights** and compute the weighted average return and risk (volatility).
7. **Use optimization to find the weights that maximize the Sharpe Ratio**.
8. **Analyze Portfolio Risk and Return**:
   - Calculate the average of the portfolio returns.
   - Measure the standard deviation of portfolio returns to understand volatility.
   - Measure the potential loss in value of Tesla stock at a given confidence interval (Value at Risk - VaR).
   - Sharpe Ratio: This tells you the risk-adjusted return. Higher is better.
9. **Optimize the Portfolio**:
   - Adjust allocations to maximize returns or minimize risks.
   - Increase stable assets like BND if you expect higher volatility in Tesla.
   - Visualize how the portfolio would perform based on the forecasted returns.
10. **Summarize the expected return, volatility, Sharpe Ratio, adjustments to asset allocation and reasons**, and include cumulative return charts and risk-return analysis.
